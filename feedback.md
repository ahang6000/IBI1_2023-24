In the formative feedback, the problem I had is "not very resonable explanation and  the first day is sed as day 1 instead of day 0" in week4.

I have change the code of week4 so that the first day was set as day0.
I also add sufficient explainations into the code

In the last practical, I had checked with Professor that I had fixed this problem.
